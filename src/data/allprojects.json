The final formalisation consisted of informative flyers, a proposal for the redesign of a neighbourhood community and two products to promote sovereignty: DEIXAM, a panel for sharing products and cures; and SEU, a collection of multipurpose furniture. La Beïnal is a proposal for a cooperative that accompanies neighbourhood communities in processes of conscience building with a vocation to work collectively for their sovereignty and sustainability. The various ways of intervening in the community would be publicised through information leaflets and there would be accompaniment and monitoring throughout the process, raising various possibilities in the community and generating new ones collectively.",
