It is an interactive installation that uses Processing to detect the faces of individuals. The programme hides the face of the people it detects behind a red dot and projects this image onto the billboard, thus guiding the public's attention to that person. In this way, the sensation of tension that was generated in the partygoers when standing before the king is reproduced, with the feeling that every action or movement that is made will be analysed and judged but without giving absolute prominence by hiding their identity.",
